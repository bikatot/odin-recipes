        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The iconic borscht is probably the most famous Ukrainian dish. It is a comforting soup made with beetroot, meat or bone stock, and sautéed vegetables. There are many variations - the broth can be made with beef, pork, chicken, or as a vegetarian version.</p>
        <p>The soup often includes fermented beetroot juice (kvass), and it is common to add meat, while typical vegetables include root vegetables and cabbage. The essential ingredient in every borscht is beetroot. It gives the dish its distinctive red color and a characteristic earthy flavor.</p>
        <p>The exact origin of this classic is difficult to trace - although it is predominately associated with Ukraine, as the country boasts the largest number of borscht varieties. Regardless of its origins, it is one of the favorite dishes across Central and Eastern Europe.</p>

                <li>½ cup finely chopped carrots</li>
                <li>¼ cup chopped green bell pepper, divided</li>
                <li>½ stalk celery, chopped</li>
                <li>1 medium beet</li>
                <li>½ cup canned peeled and diced tomatoes</li>
                <li>3 potatoes, quartered</li>
                <li>⅓ cup butter</li>
                <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
                <li>1 ½ cups canned tomatoes</li>
                <li>3 cups finely shredded cabbage, divided</li>
                <li>¼ cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>¾ cup diced potatoes</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried dill weed</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper to taste</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place water, salt, carrots, 1/2 of the bell pepper, celery, beet, tomatoes, and quartered potatoes in a large stock pot over high heat. Bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>Melt 1/3 cup butter in a separate skillet over medium heat. Saute onions in butter until tender, approximately 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, reduce heat to medium low, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove 1/2 cup of sauce from skillet, and set aside. Stir half of the cabbage into the skillet with remaining sauce, and continue simmering 5 minutes more, or until tender.</li>
            <li>Remove beet from boiling liquid and discard. Remove potatoes with a slotted spoon or tongs, and place in a bowl with remaining 1 tablespoon of butter and the cream. Mash together until smooth.</li>
            <li>Return the 1/2 cup of reserved onion-tomato sauce to the stock pot. Stir in diced potatoes, and simmer until just tender but still firm, approximately 5 minutes. Increase heat to a low boil, and stir in remaining cabbage, tomato sauce, and mashed potatoes. Reduce heat and simmer a few minutes more. Stir in remaining bell pepper, season with black pepper, and serve.</li>
        </ol>
